Don't let your dreams be dreams
Yesterday you said tomorrow, so just do it!
Make your dreams come true!
Just do it!
Some people dream of success while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it!
Nothing is impossible!
If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up
Panic attack? Attack panic first!
Make society conform to you
Can't walk into Mordor? Run into Mordor.
Lent? Give up fear.
Be brave enough to take a math test in pen.
Hit rock bottom? Good. That's a solid foundation.
Fall down seven times? Get up eight.
I didn't say it would be easy. I said it would be worth it.
Don't ask for life to be easier. Ask to be stronger.
Don't talk about it. Be about it.
Face your problems. Don't Facebook your problems.
Don't get results. Take them.
A small problem gets bigger when you ignore it. A big problem gets smaller when you attack it.
If not now, when?
Not a good day? Make it one!
You will gain success if you apply effort correctly. You will gain experience if you apply effort incorrectly. You will gain nothting if you apply no effort.
Right now you could be making progress instead of excuses.
Stop dwelling on the past. Create the future!
What's the best that could happen? Make it happen!
Make tommorrow thank you for today.
